Because Discord Canary updates so often and I can't be arsed to continuously check the AUR, I decided to write this small binary script which automatically downloads the latest version (for Linux currently) and extracts it to the home directory. The only current argument is `--download-dir` if you wish to modify the output directory.

This has recently been expanded to also suit VSCode.
